We pulled-down data on travel behaviour, public transport routes and cycle parking points.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Estimate of 'catchment areas' for cycling to a bus stop with parking"}
knitr::include_graphics("osm/3k_buffer.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, "Overview of cycle parking points (red) and bus stops (blue) in West Yorkshire"}
knitr::include_graphics("osm/screenshot_bike_parks_bus_stops.png")
```

See [here](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/316902) for an interactive prototype.


```{r, results='hide', fig.cap="Major commutes (red), bus stops (black) and cycle parking points (green)."}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
source("get_zones.R")
qtm(zones) +
qtm(bus.stops, dots.col = "black") +
qtm(bike.parking, dots.col = "green") +
qtm(lines, lines.lwd = 4)  
```



## Tech

This project uses the development version of the stplanr package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/stplanr", ref = "sfr")
```
